# Mobile Device Data Analysis (Python & Jupyter)

## Overview
Exploratory data analysis and visualization of structured CSV datasets using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.  
The project demonstrates data cleaning, statistical summaries, and visual reporting to extract insights from real-world style data.

## Tools
Python • Pandas • NumPy • Matplotlib • Jupyter Notebook • Git

## Files
- assignment3.ipynb — preprocessing and cleaning  
- assignment4.ipynb — exploratory analysis  
- assignment5.ipynb — visualization and insights  
- iphone_data_sample.csv  
- android_data_sample.csv  

## Example Output
Histogram visualization with mean and standard deviation markers:
